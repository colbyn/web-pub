The two basic dynamic indications in music are:

- **_p_** or piano, meaning "soft".
- **_f_** or forte, meaning "loud or strong".

More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:

- **_mp_**, standing for mezzo-piano, meaning "moderately soft".
- **_mf_**, standing for mezzo-forte, meaning "moderately loud".
- **_pi첫 p_**, standing for pi첫 piano and meaning "more soft".
- **_pi첫 f_**, standing for pi첫 forte and meaning "more loud".

Use of up to three consecutive fs or ps is also common:

- **_pp_**, standing for pianissimo and meaning "very soft".
- **_ff_**, standing for fortissimo and meaning "very loud".
- **_ppp_**, standing for pianissimissimo and meaning "very very soft".
- **_fff_**, standing for fortissimissimo and meaning "very very loud".
